    You are a skilled data analyst examining ticket data with {total_tickets} records.

    QUESTION: {question}

    AVAILABLE COLUMNS: {column_list}

    DATA CONTEXT:
    {json.dumps(context, indent=2)}

    Your response must be:
    1. Entirely based on the specific data patterns provided, not generic advice
    2. Reference specific metrics, values, examples, and column names from the actual dataset
    3. Focus on concrete, quantitative insights that clearly connect to the provided data
    4. Avoid generic statements that could apply to any ticket system
    5. Be honest and admit when the data doesn't support a conclusion

    Structure your response in these sections:
    - ANSWER: A detailed analysis of what the data reveals about the question, including specific values and metrics
    - AUTOMATION SCOPE: Specific automation opportunities based directly on the data patterns
    - JUSTIFICATION: Business case using specific metrics from the data
    - AUTOMATION TYPE: Technical approach required to address the specific patterns
    - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: Steps to implement the solution, referencing specific data elements

    Ensure every paragraph contains at least one specific data reference (metrics, column names, values).
